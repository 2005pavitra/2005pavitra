- 👋 Hey there, I’m Pavitra Pandey — just a regular human trying to become a billionaire, one bug at a time 💸🐞
- 
- 👀 Currently obsessed with:
   Making cool stuff with MERN/MEAN
   Pretending to understand React hooks on the first try
   Dreaming of random foreign trips with zero planning 🌍✈️
  
- 🌱 Learning:
   How not to blank out during public speaking 😅
   Life, bro. I’m learning life.
  
- 💞️ Let’s collab on:
   Anything that sounds like “We’re gonna build the next big thing”
   Tech fests, hackathons, or just chaotic late-night coding sprints 🌙💻
  
- 📫 Reach me via:
  🐦 Carrier pigeon (just kidding, use email: pavitrapandeysagar@gmail.com)
     GitHub issues if you’re feeling fancy
  
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him (aka CEO of “Bro, it was working last night”)
- ⚡ Fun fact:
      I play tabla, sing a bit, code like my life depends on it, and still somehow vibe with bhajans and deep tech convos. Also, I made ChatGPT call itself Tech Buddy. That’s peak main character energy.
